# GTA-V-C-Script-Mod
~~This is a testbed for a mod for GTA V written in C#~~

This is a mod for GTA V written in C#.

It contains exactly two gameplay changes:
When you press 'y', the nearest pedestrian to the player will put their hands up.
When you press 'l', the nearest pedestrian to the player will join your group, which means they will follow you and attack hostile NPCs.

In order to install and use it you'll need to first install a scriptloader mod...
Or something... I don't really remember, I published this like 5 years ago so that's as much documentation as you're gonna get.
